/*
 * qemu_vm.h -- macOS QEMU+HVF backend for a Windows guest (the VzVm peer).
 *
 * AppSandbox on Mac launches Windows VMs by driving the vendored QEMU (HVF acceleration, EDK2
 * firmware) instead of Virtualization.framework. The guest talks to the host over ivshmem shared
 * memory (no vsock), so QemuVm:
 *   1. creates + sizes the ivshmem backing file and PUBLISHES the asb_transport directory into it
 *      (asb_shm_publish) BEFORE launching QEMU, so guest services select ivshmem at boot;
 *   2. launches qemu-system-aarch64 as a child process (NVMe disk.img, vmnet NAT, -display none,
 *      ivshmem-plain + memory-backend-file, guest Secure Boot off in testMode, NO GPU);
 *   3. maps the backing as an AsbIvshmemTransport the channel helpers use (agent/ssh/clipboard);
 *   4. tracks the child + QMP and reports lifecycle transitions.
 *
 * Mirrors how Windows HCS defines the VM (hcs_vm.c), minus GPU-PV and with the HvSocket ServiceTable
 * replaced by the ivshmem device.
